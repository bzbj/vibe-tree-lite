# Vibe Tree Cloud Worker

Cloudflare Worker + D1 backend for three opt-in cloud features:

- Private shared tree sync, so one GitHub account can keep growing the same tree across devices.
- Optional global leaderboard publishing.
- Friends and groups, including group-specific contribution leaderboards.

The desktop app never uploads prompts, replies, code files, local paths, session text, raw notes, or per-event model/provider labels. Shared tree sync sends token ledger events with safe source categories, device id, achievement unlock state, coarse device summaries, and daily aggregate model totals grouped by device/source/model. Leaderboard and group sync send daily token totals, recent hourly token aggregates, and the local first-use date; if a user explicitly enables public usage preferences, it also sends range-scoped aggregate preferences only: top agent percentage, top model, preferred coding period, and peak token/min.

The first release is community-oriented, not strict cheat-proof scoring. The backend keeps only broad safety rails:

- Daily payloads above `1,000,000,000,000,000` tokens are rejected as obviously invalid dirty data.
- Each GitHub user can sync at most once every 30 seconds.
- Leaderboard sync accepts only the latest 30 daily rows plus recent hourly rows for the rolling 24h leaderboard, while the database retains older daily rows that were synced in previous windows for the all-time leaderboard.
- Cloudflare Worker rate limit bindings throttle leaderboard reads, OAuth entry points, and write APIs per IP and route.
- Suspicious events are written as structured Workers Logs. High-signal non-rate-limit events are also stored in D1 `security_events` with hashed IP values; rate-limit and normal sync-cooldown hits stay out of D1 to avoid turning button mashing into write load.

The IP limit is a coarse abuse brake, not identity. Public networks, VPNs, mobile carriers, and corporate NATs may share an IP, so the Worker also keeps the per-GitHub-user sync cooldown.

Current rate limits are intentionally generous while usage is small:

- Public leaderboard reads: `600/min/IP`.
- Write APIs, including usage sync and account deletion: `300/min/IP`.
- Auth routes: `20/min/IP`.

The Worker rate-limit binding only supports 10-second or 60-second windows, so hour-level limits are deferred until real traffic justifies adding a Durable Object counter.

## Routes

### Auth

- `GET /auth/github/start` starts the GitHub OAuth flow.
- `GET /auth/github/callback` completes OAuth and returns a short-lived one-time code to the desktop app's localhost callback.
- `POST /auth/session` exchanges the one-time code plus the app-held verifier for a session token.
- `GET /api/me` returns the signed-in GitHub profile.
- `DELETE /api/me` removes the user, sessions, leaderboard token rows, public preference rows, shared tree events, achievements, device summaries, aggregate model stats, sync state, auth codes, and user-linked security log rows.

### Shared Tree Sync

- `GET /api/tree` returns cloud tree events, achievements, device summaries, aggregate model stats, and a summary with `hasRemoteTree`.
- `GET /api/tree?modelStatsOnly=1` returns the same payload without the raw event stream (events and achievements are empty). Use it for aggregate-only readers such as a usage dashboard, which then transfer the daily model totals instead of up to 50k events.
- `POST /api/tree/events` upserts token events, refreshes the current device snapshot, and replaces that device's aggregate model stats when provided.
- `POST /api/tree/achievements` upserts achievement unlock state.

Remote tree existence is true when the account has any tree events, achievements, device snapshots, or aggregate model stats. This lets a second device join a tree that was just enabled on the first device before any token was produced.

### Leaderboard

- `POST /api/usage/daily` upserts daily token aggregates, recent hourly token aggregates, and, when opted in, range-scoped aggregate usage preferences.
- `GET /api/leaderboard?range=24h|7d|30d|all` returns the top 100 users plus public preference details when the user opted in. `range=today` is accepted as a legacy alias for `24h`.
- `GET /api/leaderboards` returns all four leaderboard ranges in one response.

### Social

- `GET /api/social/friends` returns accepted friends plus incoming and outgoing requests.
- `POST /api/social/friends` sends a friend request by GitHub username.
- `POST /api/social/friends/:userId/accept` accepts an incoming friend request.
- `DELETE /api/social/friends/:userId` removes a friend or pending request.
- `GET /api/social/groups` returns the current user's groups.
- `POST /api/social/groups` creates a group and makes the creator the owner.
- `GET /api/social/groups/:groupId` returns group membership details.
- `POST /api/social/groups/:groupId/invites` creates a shareable invite code for group owners.
- `DELETE /api/social/groups/:groupId/members/me` leaves a group. Owners cannot leave until ownership transfer or deletion exists.
- `POST /api/social/groups/:groupId/membership` updates the current member's per-group usage sharing flag.
- `GET /api/social/groups/:groupId/leaderboard?range=24h|7d|30d|all&basis=total|since_join` returns a private-scope member leaderboard. Membership plus `share_usage` controls visibility; `basis=total` is lifetime/range total, while `basis=since_join` counts only usage after the member joined the group.
- `POST /api/social/invites/:code/accept` joins a group by invite code.
- `GET /api/social/profile-privacy` returns the signed-in user's profile card visibility settings.
- `POST /api/social/profile-privacy` updates who can open the user's profile card and which growth fields are exposed to non-self viewers.
- `GET /api/social/users/:userId/profile` returns a relationship-gated profile card for the signed-in user, an accepted friend, or a co-member.

Social leaderboards use the same aggregate daily/hourly token rows as the global leaderboard. Joining a group can sync those aggregates without making the user visible on the global leaderboard; profile cards also enforce per-field privacy server-side. Prompts, sessions, files, paths, and source text are still never uploaded.

## Setup

1. Create a GitHub OAuth app.

   Homepage URL:

   ```text
   https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev
   ```

   Authorization callback URL:

   ```text
   https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev/auth/github/callback
   ```

2. Create a D1 database and replace `database_id` in `wrangler.jsonc`.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create vibe-tree-leaderboard
   ```

3. Add secrets.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   npx wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
   npx wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET
   ```

   `SESSION_SECRET` should be a long random string.

4. Run migrations and deploy.

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:migrate:privacy
   npm run db:migrate:sources
   npm run db:migrate:dedupe
   npm run db:migrate:devices
   npm run db:migrate:hourly
   npm run db:migrate:delta
   npm run db:migrate:social
   npm run db:migrate:social-friends
   npm run db:migrate:usage-visibility
   npm run db:migrate:social-invite-redemptions
   npm run db:migrate:social-profile-privacy
   npm run db:migrate:usage-totals
   npm run deploy
   ```

   For a fresh database, `db:migrate` creates all current tables. The extra migration scripts are safe to run for upgraded deployments that may already contain older cloud-tree tables, old source rows, missing hourly leaderboard rows, missing `tree_device_stats` device contribution totals, missing social tables, missing global-visibility rows, missing invite redemption tracking, missing profile privacy settings, or missing compact lifetime usage totals.

5. Start the desktop app with the Worker URL, or set this as the production default in the Electron app.

   ```bash
   VIBE_TREE_LEADERBOARD_API_URL=https://your-worker-subdomain.workers.dev npm start
   ```

Packaged builds can keep a production Worker URL in the Electron app and still use `VIBE_TREE_LEADERBOARD_API_URL` as a local override.

## Monitoring

Workers Logs are enabled in `wrangler.jsonc`. Filter for `leaderboard_security` to inspect rate limits, auth failures, sync cooldowns, invalid payloads, and server errors. The D1 `security_events` table keeps the non-rate-limit events for quick review.

Useful checks:

```bash
npx wrangler tail vibe-tree-leaderboard --format=pretty
npx wrangler d1 execute vibe-tree-leaderboard --remote --command "SELECT created_at, type, path, status, country FROM security_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"
npm run verify:api
```

For push alerts, connect Workers Logs to Cloudflare Notifications, Logpush, or a Tail Worker that forwards high-severity events to your alert destination.
